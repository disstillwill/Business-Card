This business card modifies Olivier Pieters's design from [https://github.com/opieters/business-card](https://github.com/opieters/business-card) (See LICENSE.txt). The design has been changed to use a side-by-side layout with an initial on the left and contact information on the right. The back features a QR code that can be scanned to pull up a [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard). Of course, ~~Computer~~ Latin Modern is the star of the show here 😜.

## Usage

- Use the included makefile to build both documents (if using `pdflatex`)
    - If using another method, you may need to compile each `.tex` file twice to render the layout correctly
