This business card modifies Olivier Pieters's design from [https://github.com/opieters/business-card](https://github.com/opieters/business-card) (See LICENSE.txt). The design has been changed to use a side-by-side layout with an initial on the left and contact information on the right. The back features a QR code that can be scanned to pull up a [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard). Of course, Computer Modern is the star of the show here ðŸ˜œ.
